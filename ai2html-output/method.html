        <p>In January 2025, a panel discussion at UC Berkeley, titled “Feminist and Queer Solidarities with Palestine”,
            organized
            by the gender and women’s studies department, came under fire from a faculty member for having an event
            description that
            challenged Israel’s claim of widespread sexual assault during the October 7th, 2023 attacks, although
            multiple news
            outlets, including Al Jazeera’s I-Unit have found <a
                href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/21/october-7-forensic-analysis-shows-hamas-abuses-many-false-israeli-claims">insufficient
                evidence</a> to support that claim.</p>

        <p><a
                href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-01-24/ty-article/.premium/berkeley-event-to-examine-how-zionism-weaponized-feminism-to-serve-a-genocidal-agenda/00000194-9533-da26-add4-ff7be4de0000">First
                reported in Haaretz</a>, emails leaked to the Israeli
            news outlet cited Berkeley law professor, Steven Davidoff
            Solomon, writing that the event represented a “disgustingly antisemitic new low, even at Berkeley,” to the
            university
            administrators. He further warned that this could imperil university funding and expose international
            students to visa
            revocations under the Trump administrations crackdown on Pro-Palestinian supporters. The University
            investigated and
            eventually concluded that they had “no legitimate ability to alter or cancel”, since it did not go against
            school
            policy, especially since the panel did not mandate any kind of student attendance. However, the
            administrators did
            remove the contentious event description from the event’s main page. After the decision, Solomon wrote an
            op-ed (not his
            first on apparent Antisemitism at Berkeley) titled <a

            college campuses – which were always hotbeds of political activism – are being thrown into the spotlight
            even more than
            before. While protests may be front and center, a different, quieter type of censorship, like the example
            above, called
            “Deplatforming”, continues to grow on higher education campuses across the United States.
        </p>

        <p>“Deplatforming is the successful censorship of, or the attempt to censor, campus events open to the public.
            Deplatforming can include disinviting speakers, canceling performances, taking down art exhibits, or
            preventing the
            showing of a film. It can include censorship or attempts at censorship that occurred either before or during
            an event,
            but not those that occurred after an event,” according to the Foundation of Individual Rights and
            Expression. In early
            2024, the nonpartisan advocacy organization released their <a
                href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database">"Campus Deplatforming
                Database”</a>, chronicling attempted or
            successful deplatforming incidents on college campuses from 1998 to 2024. Although their website states that
            the data is
            self-reported, FIRE staffer Sean Stevens, who is also responsible for the maintenance of this database, said
            that most
            of these incidents are catalogued using media reports, student journalism and the letters that FIRE writes
            to higher
            education institutions when it believes that a violation of individual freedom or rights to expression have
            occurred.
            FIRE makes it clear that the data collected is still an undercount, with many censorship attempts likely
            flying under
            the radar despite their best efforts to catalogue them.

        <br>
        <p>Campus deplatforming attempts have shot up post-pandemic, hitting a historic high of 172 incidents in 2024,
            with over
            half of those incidents resulting in successful censorship of artwork, commencement speeches, performances
            and others.
            For example, West Texas A&M University’s President banned a student group’s charity drag show in 2023 based
            on his own
            personal beliefs, calling them “derisive, divisive and demoralizing misogyny”. The ban remained in place all
            through
            2024, preventing the show’s performance.</p>

        <p>2025 has already seen 44 deplatforming attempts as of March 20th, which is when the database was last
            updated.</p>

        <h2>Who Is Censoring Who?</h2>

        <p>Roughly 95% of the deplatforming incidents came from sources that had a clear liberal or conservative
            political ideology
            and each party initiated a censorship attempt towards the other roughly the same number of times.
            Deplatforming attempts
            started by the left were successful half the time whereas the ones initiated by the right were successful
            one-third of
            the times.
        </p>

        <p>To conclude that the “left censors more” from these raw numbers across more than 25 years would not carry the
            required
            nuance, before looking into how important yet contentious topics were handled by either side and what each
            considered
            offensive.
        </p>

        <p>Here are the ten topics that faced the most deplatforming incidents from the left as well as the right. They
            are
            arranged from the most polarising topics (where the two sides differed significantly in their frequency of
            censorship)
            to the least polarising (where the two parties tried to censor the other with similar frequency).
        </p>

            "When students no longer feel safe to express unpopular viewpoints, we've failed at our primary educational
            mission."
        </div>
        -->

        <h3>Race</h3>

        <p>The left tried to deplatform public events surrounding racial discourse nearly five times the amount that the
            right did.
            With race and most other topics, many of the deplatforming incidents were logged in FIRE’s database as
            compound topics –
            that is, as a combination of two or more topics. For example, race and immigration or race and sexuality
            often went
            together.
        </p>

        <p>Analysis of all the incidents that had race as at least one topic revealed patterns of attempted censorship.
        </p>

        <p>Left-initiated deplatforming attempts around race typically targeted speakers accused of racism or racially
            insensitive
            behavior. In many cases, students or faculty protested invitations extended to individuals who had made
            controversial
            statements about race, were involved in racially charged incidents, or were seen as representing policies or
            viewpoints
            that marginalized Black or Indigenous communities. For example, when Jared Taylor, media-dubbed white
            supremecist and
            self monikered “white advocate” and “racialist who believes in race-realism”, was invited to speak at
            Arizona State
            University in 2022, several student and outside groups called on university administrators to <a
                href="https://nevalleynews.org/16748/news/white-nationalist-jared-taylor-to-speak-at-asu-amid-growing-condemnation/">rescind
                his invite</a> due to
            Taylor’s “white identity politics’. The university did not cave and Taylor spoke successfully.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, right-initiated deplatforming around race centered on pushback against discussions of
            structural
            racism or white supremacy, often targeting speakers, faculty, or artists seen as promoting “divisive” or
            “anti-American”
            narratives, arguing that such content unfairly stigmatized white students or portrayed the U.S. in a
            negative light. For
            instance, in 2022, Daytona State College cancelled an art exhibition titled “Stranger Fruit” depicting Black
            mothers
            holding their children in lifeless poses to symbolize enduring maternal and familial grief in the face of
            racially
            motivated police brutality. The exhibition room’s HVAC system was cited as the reason for indefinite
            cancellation but
            <a
                href="https://www.thefire.org/sites/default/files/2023/09/NCAC%20ACLU-FL%20FIRE%20-%20Joint%20Letter%20to%20Daytona%20State%20College.pdf">three
                whistleblowers</a> revealed that the school was worried about the politically charged nature of the
            exhibit,
            especially because of their small police training program.
        </p>

        <h3>Sexuality</h3>

        <p>When it comes to sexuality related deplatforming events, the right initiated them 2.5 times more than the
            left.</p>

        <p>Right-wing deplatforming about sexuality revolved around drag performances, queer art, or sex education
            events and
            argued that such events are “inappropriate” or “immoral,” especially if they involve young audiences or are
            publicly
            funded. For example, the Purdue University Student Union Board planned to host an event called <a
                href="https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_5a2cfce2-6572-11ed-a97e-7b76edca97ab.html">"Sex in
                the Dark"</a>, a sex
            education presentation that would allow students to ask anonymous questions to two "sex experts". However,
            administrators postponed the event after receiving complaints from another student group called Boiler
            Catholics that
            the event was "promoting premarital sex and hookup culture." The event does not appear to have been
            rescheduled.</p>

        <p>Left-initiated deplatforming attempts involving sexuality often target events or speakers that are seen as
            promoting
            homophobia, transphobia, or exclusionary gender politics. In 2022, one such event led by students in Ohio
            State
            University called for the <a
                href="https://www.change.org/p/osu-cancel-homophobic-donor-pat-gelsinger-as-spring-commencement-speaker?source_location=search">disinvitation
                of Patrick Geslinger</a>, then CEO of intel, as commencement speaker, for his
            anti-LGBTQ views and support of campus organizations that forbid LGBTQ volunteers and staff.</p>

        <h3>Israel-Palestine</h3>

        <p>As the Palestinian genocide continues, higher education has been rife with both Pro-Palestinian and
            Pro-Israel protests.
            This trend is also reflected in deplatforming events where each side had equally attempted to censor
            incidents related
            to Israel or Palestine.</p>

        <p>Left-led deplatforming attempts related to Israel often emerge when the invited speakers are linked to
            pro-Israel
            military, political, or corporate institutions. In 2024, Yale Law School's chapter of Students for Justice
            in Palestine
            called on the university to <a
                href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/psychologically-unsafe-yale-law-students-protest-idf-soldiers-campus-visit/">cancel</a>
            former IDF soldier, Ezra Grushko's speech
            because "the platforming of an IDF combatant recently returned from
            Israel's atrocities in Gaza makes many of us—especially Palestinian Arab, Muslim, Black, and brown students
            — feel
            physically and psychologically unsafe and unwelcome in our own school," and because he planned to share his
            "personal
            perspective" on fighting "terrorist organizations in Gaza" — statements that SJP considered Islamophobic and
            racist.
            Grushko spoke successfully.</p>

        <p>Right-aligned protests against Israel/Palestine events usually object to pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel
            speakers, and
            believe those are threatening to Jewish students' safety. In recent events, conservative alumni and advocacy
            groups have
            pushed universities to cancel these events outright, and have criticized administrations for allowing
            platforms that
            challenge U.S. and Israeli foreign policy. At the University of North Texas this year,
            multiple <a href="https://x.com/realmitchlittle/status/1896667487321952705">state representatives</a> wrote
            to the
            university demanding the cancellation of Associate Dean of Student Affairs, Nancy Stockdale's lecture titled
            "Palestinian Children and the Politics of Genocide," scheduled as part of a commemorative lecture series ,
            because
            Stockdale used the term "genocide" in the lecture's title. Stockdale successfully presented her lecture on
            April 3rd.</p>

        <h2>State Patterns Of Deplatforming</h2>

        <p>On the map above, you can explore how each state deals with deplatforming events and whether the right or
            left is
            successful in its deplatforming attempts. The color of the state represents which ideology is receiving more
            censorship
            overall.</p>

        <p>For instance, in California, 61% of deplatforming attempts initiated by the left are successful, which means
            that the majority of the time, the right-wing is being censored. To reiterate, the color of the state
            reflects which
            party is being censored more in that region.</p>

        <!-- HEADER SECTION

        </blockquote>
        -->
        <p>The map reveals further nuance in the regional rate of success of deplatforming attempts. In states like Ohio
            and Utah, rate
            of successful censorship through deplatforming attempts is fairly similar whether it is initiated by the
            left or the right. However,
            in other states such as Louisiana, the divide is wide, with conservatives facing censorship more. Even
            though Louisiana is
            traditionally a red state, such patterns might indicate that campus poltical activism might not always
            reflect the state's political bend,
            further cementing higher education institutions as intersections of independent thought and activism, making
            it all the more important to protect
            the freedom of individual rights and expression exhibited there.</p>

                    <p>The data used for this project comes from the Campus Deplatforming Database published by the
                        Freedom of Individual Rights and Expression
                        (FIRE), and contains censorship incidents at U.S. higher education institutions spanning from
                        1998 to 2025. A deplatforming incident is one where individuals or groups were denied platforms
                        to
                        express their views on college campuses.</p>

                    <p>I used web scraping techniques (Playwright and BeautifulSoup) to extract data from 69 pages of
                        FIRE's
                        embedded table, capturing both the summary information and detailed metadata from each
                        incident's
                        dedicated page. This technical approach allowed me to compile a comprehensive dataset in an
                        analyzable form</p>

                    <p>The raw data required some cleaning and standardization. I added additional geographical
                        information,
                        corrected inconsistent topic classifications, and separated composite
                        topics (like "Gender, Sexuality, Race") to enable accurate analysis. I also created a binary
                        variable
                        to distinguish between attempted and successful deplatforming efforts.
                    </p>

                    <p>Approximately 5% of the database lacked clear political motivation classification and data
                        interviews were conducted with FIRE staff to determine
                        the basis for catch-all terms such as "Not applicable".
                    </p>

                    <p>To identify patterns in campus censorship, I performed data analysis on topics targeted
                        for deplatforming, political motivations behind censorship attempts, success rates, and
                        institutional responses over time. I also manually read and annotated incidents that fell under
                        Race, Sexuality and Israel-Palestine
                        to accurately report on what each political side was trying to censor or was offended by. The
                        visualizations were created using Datawrapper</p>

                    <p>It's worth noting that this dataset represents a conservative estimate of campus deplatforming
                        incidents, as acknowledged in FIRE's methodology. The database primarily includes events
                        documented
                        through media reports, institutional correspondence, and student reporting, followed by FIRE's
                        fact-checking procedures and at the time of this piece, had been updated on March 20th, 2025.
